# Recommendations_for_tomato_crop_disease_prediction_and_management_system
##This project presents a deep learning-based application for identifying diseases in tomato crops and recommending suitable pesticides to help farmers manage crop health more effectively. Using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system analyzes images of tomato leaves uploaded by the user, classifies the disease, and suggests relevant treatment options.

#Features
Disease Detection: Classifies tomato leaf diseases with high accuracy based on uploaded images.
Pesticide Recommendation: Suggests effective pesticides for identified diseases.
Image Preprocessing: Utilizes OpenCV for resizing, normalizing, and preparing images for consistent model performance.
Robust Architecture: Built with Flask for a user-friendly interface, reliable file handling, and error management.
#Technologies Used
Deep Learning: Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for disease classification.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing, including resizing and normalization.
Flask: Backend framework to create a lightweight and easy-to-deploy web application.
Operating System (OS) Functions: Manages file uploads, handles errors, and ensures smooth integration between frontend and backend.
